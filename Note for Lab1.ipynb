Yesterday I counted and realized that >on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this >company.  >I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask >me some kind of question...  Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.  >So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single >person had already left for lunch.
